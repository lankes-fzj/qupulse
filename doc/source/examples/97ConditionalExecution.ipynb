    "# Conditional Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "The qctoolkit is desinged to support conditional execution of pulse (segments). This allows pulse designers to play back different waveforms depending on, e.g., environment data or state measurements of the quantum dot. Conditional execution may be implemented via trigger-based jumps to instructions directly on the playback device or emulated in software by choosing which pulse to send to the hardware for playback, if the hardware itself does not support branching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the decision whether a condition will be evaluated software- or hardware-based depends on the hardware setup of the experiment and not on the pulse template the qctoolkit relies on an indirection scheme for conditions which is similar to the handling of parameters, as you will see in the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "qctoolkit offers two `PulseTemplate` subclasses for conditional execution: `LoopPulseTemplate` and `BranchPulseTemplate`. \n",
    "\n",
    "`LoopPulseTemplate` takes an identifier for a condition and a subtemplate which is repeated as long as the condition evaluates to `True`. Let's assume that we want to construct a pulse that waits until some initialization is completed using a `TablePulseTemplate` representing a zero-pulse of length 5 and a `LoopPulseTemplate`:"

    "We will now look into the actual implementation of conditions. The abstract interface of conditions is the `Condition` class. As mentioned in the beginning, conditions can be evaluated software- and hardware-based. The classes `SoftwareCondition` and `HardwareCondition` represent this in the qctoolkit. Note that these classes don't do the actual evaluation but encapsulate it against the `Sequencer` and are used to generate correct sequences for both cases. Instances of `Condition`s are passed directly into the `Sequencer` and mapped to the `PulseTemplate`s via the identifier, similar to parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Software-Based Conditions\n",
    "`SoftwareCondition` takes a callback function which is called to evaluate the condition (and thus must return a boolean value). During the sequencing process, this function will be called. If the return value is `True`, the subtemplate will be included in the instruction sequence and another evaluation will be made until the return value is `False`. The generated instruction sequence will thus contain a number of repetitions of the subtemplate but no actual jumping instructions, the loop is essentially unrolled. The callback function is passed an integer value indicating the current iteration of the evaluation.\n",
